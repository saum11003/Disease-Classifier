# Disease-Classifier
In this project, I leveraged machine learning algorithms to predict diseases based on symptoms, aiming to enhance healthcare outcomes through early detection and intervention. Our approach begins with preprocessing a dataset containing disease labels and associated symptoms. We meticulously clean the data, extracting key symptom keywords and converting them into numerical feature vectors through vectorization techniques. Subsequently, we implement four prominent algorithms—Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest, Decision Tree Classifier—for disease prediction. Each model is trained on the preprocessed dataset, utilising symptom features to predict the presence or absence of specific diseases. Through a rigorous comparative analysis, we evaluate the performance of each model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, alongside techniques such as cross-validation to ensure robustness.
